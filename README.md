# TodoList

### technologies and their versions
- [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) 16.2.0;
- Bootstrap 5.2;
- Angular Material, FormsModule and ReactiveFormsModule, ViewEncapsulation;
- Sass preprocessor;
- meta & OGP tags;
- Deploy by angular-cli-ghpages;


## a Todo list has abilities like
- Display item list;
- Filtered items by **'all'**, **'todo'** and **'done'** actions;
- Capability to add, edit, save and delete items
- **Validation** â€“ not allowing empty input fields and more than 33 characters in item;
- And a little bonus is the cute design ðŸ˜‰
- You can compare the design from **Figma** and the implemented code  [![](https://img.shields.io/badge/Click_me_&#10138;-brightgreen?style=for-the-badge)](https://www.figma.com/community/file/1271828665006307996/Todo-list)


## was a challenge for me
1. when I have been implementing save, delete and select item actions, forgot to make it by index. Therefore lists were not synchronized with each other.
2. I forgot about Module rules, Component rules (declaration)  - fix it


## was simple for me
1. as usual, design (especially by Bootstrap);
2. HTML5 semantic;
3. using **Angular Material** (although it's new for me);
4. performing validation
